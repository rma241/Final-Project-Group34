Overview
This project analyzes various criteria to assist individuals in making informed decisions when searching for apartments to rent in New York City. The data analysis focuses on three aspects: historical monthly average rents by from Zillow, NYC 311 service requests/complaints, and the distribution of trees across the city. The project researched 6 specific questions and created visualizations that enhanced the overall understanding of the data as well as the rental situation.

- Schemas for creating database tables are included in "schema.sql". 
- SQL queries are used to answer each of the questions and saved as corresponding .sql files in the "queries" folder. 
- The file "requirement.txt" records all the third-party Python libraries that need to be installed.
